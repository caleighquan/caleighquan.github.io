This website serves as my personal portfolio that showcases my skills, projects, and interactive visualizations. It is designed to highlight my experience in UX/UI design, front-end development, and data visualization.

Purpose:
    The main purpose of this website is to introduce myself and what my design focus is. Also, it displays one of my projects I have worked on, VanVentures. I showcase my education, skills, and courework relevant to my porfolio. Finally, I used this website to show my visualizations using SVG's in JavaScript to display data about myself.

Technologies Used:
    I used HTML to create the structure of the website and CSS to style and create the responsiveness of the website. JavaScript was used to create interactive features like my logo shaking when hovering and my buttons enlarging when hovered over. Also, it was used to create my SVG visuals on my visualization page. I used Figma to create my SVG logo.

Navigation:
    There are two tabs in my navigation bar that will bring users either to the home page or the visualization page. Also, my logo will bring them back to the home page. Users can click the buttons found in my intro section to direct them to either my GitHub or my Linkedin. If users scroll all the way to the bottom, they will find my contact information where they can click to send me an email, go to my GitHub, or go to my Linkedin.
